*rotations count as a solution

a) 2x2
	There can be at most 1 queen on the board because it removes all positions.
	There are no solutions.

b) 3x3
	There can be at most 2 queens on the board. After the second queen is placed, there are no more empty positions.
	There are no solutions.

c) 4x4
	There can be at most 4 queens on the board. I solved it, and found out that other solutions could be found by rotating the board by 90 degrees, and also by reflecting it from that position.
	There are 8 solutions.

d) 5x5
	There can be at most 5 queens on the board. I solved it, and unlike the 4x4, the rotations by 90 degrees do not work.
	There are 2 solutions (the original and its reflection).

e) 6x6
	There can be at most 6 queens on the board due to induction with previous cases.
	There are 8 solutions. (may be missing some)

f) 7x7
	There can be at most 7 queens on the board due to induction with previous cases.
	There are ____ solutions. (don’t know yet)

g) 8x8
	There can be at most 8 queens on the board. 
	There are ____ solutions. (don’t know yet)
